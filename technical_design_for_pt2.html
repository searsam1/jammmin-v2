    <h3>OBJECTIVE</h3>
    <p>
        Show only the songs in the search results that are
        not already included in the playlist.
    </p>

    <h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
    <p>
        This feature is crucial as it prevents users from accidentally adding the same song to a playlist multiple times
        during a search. This enhances the app's usability, making it more efficient and user-friendly by assuming that
        users don't want to see tracks they've already added to the playlist.
    </p>

    <p>
        Time-saving is an essential aspect of this feature. By streamlining the playlist creation process, the app helps
        users create playlists that match their musical preferences more easily and quickly.
    </p>

    <p>
        For instance, if a user already has songs in their playlist and performs a different search to find new tracks,
        displaying songs that are already in the playlist in the search results is redundant and unnecessary.
    </p>

    <h3>TECHNICAL DESIGN</h3>
    <p>
        After getting the tracks from spotify, map over them and 
        only display ones not in the playlist already. Do this by using 
        the track ids or uris. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The .filter method is suitable here, and not .map, because 
        we are filtering out the songs that have already been added 
        to the playlist. 
    </p>

    <h3>CAVEATS</h3>
    <p>

        The optimal scenario would involve the Spotify API providing a feature to filter out specific songs from the search results.
        A challenge emerges when the playlist contains a substantial number of songs, resulting in users being unable to view any tracks or only a limited number.
        A potential workaround is to surpass the default limit of 20 results and raise it to the maximum of 50. However, this approach doesn't fully address the problem.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Spotify API does, however, offer a next URL in the response, which 
        does offer potential solutions.
